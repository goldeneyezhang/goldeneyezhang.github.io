# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  世上决没有无缘无的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。至于所谓“人类之爱”，自从人类分化成为阶级以后，就没有过这种统一的爱。过去的一切统治阶级喜欢提倡这个东西，许多所谓圣人贤人也喜欢提倡这个东西，但是无论谁都没有真正实行过，因为它在阶级社会里是不可能实行的。
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
